## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option 1: Browser Extension

The easiest way to install this functionality is by using the browser extension. You can install the extension directly into Chrome or other Chromium-based browsers.

#### Steps to Install:
1. **Clone this repository:**
```base
git clone https://github.com/psparwez/open-in-vsode.git
```


2. **Load the extension into your browser:**
- Open Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser like Edge).
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
- Enable **Developer Mode** in the top right.
- Click on **Load unpacked** and select the directory of the cloned repo.

3. **Verify the installation:**
- Navigate to any GitHub repository page (e.g., `https://github.com/{username}/{repo-name}`).
- You should now see the **"Open in VSCode"** button appear on the repository page.
- Click the button to open the repository directly in **Visual Studio Code**.

#### Notes:
- This extension works only if **Visual Studio Code** is installed on your system.
- Ensure you have authentication set up in VS Code for private repositories.

### Option 2: Using the Script Directly (No Extension)

If you prefer not to install the browser extension, you can use this script directly with a userscript manager like **Tampermonkey** or **Greasemonkey**.

- [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://www.greasespot.net/)

2. **Create a new userscript:**
- Open the userscript manager and create a new script.
- Copy and paste the `content.js` code from this repository into the script editor.

3. **Save and Activate the Script:**
- Save the script and refresh any GitHub repository page.
- The **"Open in VSCode"** button should appear on the page.
